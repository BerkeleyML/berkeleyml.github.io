Below are quick answers to common questions. For full details, see the [Syllabus](../syllabus).

- **What are the prerequisites?**
  Multivariable Calculus (MATH 53), Linear Algebra (MATH 54 or equivalent), and Probability/Discrete Math (COMPSCI 70 or equivalent). You should be comfortable with vector calculus, matrix operations, probability, and Python programming.

- **When and how are lectures and discussions run?**
  Lectures are Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:00–3:30 PM. Participation is via in-lecture polls (synchronous) or an asynchronous link after lecture; graded on completion. Discussions are 1 hour on Wed/Thu; ungraded but highly recommended.

- **How are homeworks structured and when are they due?**
  There are 5 homeworks. Each has two parts: Part 1 (Warmup) and Part 2 (Main). Both parts are released together. Deadlines are 11:59 PM Pacific on posted dates. Submit on Gradescope (written and/or coding portals as applicable).

- **How do slip days work?**
  You have 10 total slip days across all homeworks, with a maximum of 4 per homework. Slip days apply automatically by submission timestamp; any amount late up to 24 hours counts as 1 slip day. After 4 days late, submissions aren’t accepted without approved accommodations.

- **Are there alternate exams?**
  No. There are two in-person exams (Midterm and Final). See the [Syllabus → Exams](../syllabus#exams) for dates and policies.

- **What is the graduate final project (CS 289)?**
  A team-based project in the second half of the semester; details announced mid-semester.

- **How is the course graded?**
  CS 189/289A: Homework (35%), Midterm (25%), Final (30%), Lecture Attendance/Participation (10%). CS 289: Homework (30%), Midterm (25%), Final (25%), Lecture Attendance/Participation (10%), Grad Project (10%). You must earn at least a 50% weighted average across the midterm and final to pass.

- **How do regrade requests work?**
  Allowed for written and autograded components where the rubric/application is incorrect. Submit within one week of grade release (Gradescope for written; a form for autograder issues).

- **What is the collaboration and academic honesty policy?**
  You may discuss ideas/approaches with peers, but all solutions and code must be your own. Do not share solutions or use unauthorized resources. See [Syllabus → Collaboration Policy](../syllabus#collaboration-policy-and-academic-honesty).

- **How do I get help or contact staff?**
  Office hours are on the [Calendar](../calendar). Use Ed for course Q&A and announcements. For sensitive matters, email the staff at {{ page.course.email | default: 'cs189-instructors@berkeley.edu' }}.

- **How do additional accommodations and DSP work?**
  Use the [Additional Accommodations Form](https://forms.gle/spBZoWV4XZcxqZjh8){:target="_blank"} for situations not covered by slip days. DSP students receive approved extensions (2-day automatic extension on homeworks). Extension + slip days must be ≤ 7 days without a required meeting. See [Syllabus → DSP Accommodations](../syllabus#dsp-accommodations).
